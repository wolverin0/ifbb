## Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **Audio Files:** Currently uses placeholder paths (`/audio/{id}.mp3`)

## Future Integration Points

2. Approval action: POST /api/admin/songs/{id}/approve
3. Rejection action: POST /api/admin/songs/{id}/reject
4. Bulk operations: POST /api/admin/songs/bulk/approve
```

### Notification Integration
```
1. Send email on approval: notifyAthleteApproved(id)
2. Send email on rejection: notifyAthleteRejected(id, reason)
3. Update athlete profile: markSongApproved(id)
```

### Audit Logging
