SYSTEM / ROLE

1) Athlete Registration & Payments
2) Events & Live Results
3) News & Media (photos/video)
4) Sponsor/Brand Integrations
5) Admin/CRM (judges, categories, rosters, invoicing, photo sales)
Target org: IFBB Argentina (bodybuilding). Audience: athletes, coaches, judges, photographers, sponsors, fans, gyms.

INPUTS

- Brand name: {{brand_name}}
- Primary locale: es-AR (Spanish, Argentina) with en-US fallback

STYLE DIRECTIONS (Modern Eye Candy)
- Vibe: elite, powerful, cinematic; “stage lights + matte black + metallic accents”.
- Color tokens: 
  -- Base: #0B0B0F (ink), #111827 (slate), #F8FAFC (paper)
  -- Accents: #B78B1E (gold), #8B5CF6 (amethyst), #22D3EE (cyan)
  Provide light/dark modes with token names (e.g., --bg, --card, --text-muted, --accent-1…).
- Typography: variable sans (e.g., Inter) + condensed display for numbers/placings.
- Motion: subtle micro-interactions (hover lift, magnetic buttons, springy tabs), 200–300ms; parallax hero with spotlight gradient. Zero jank.
- Layout: 12-col responsive grid, generous negative space, cards with soft shadows (lg) + rounded-2xl, glass/metal overlays for hero.
- Imagery: high-contrast athlete shots, stage lighting bokeh, geometric mesh backgrounds. Provide royalty-free placeholders.

PAGES & KEY SECTIONS (DELIVERABLES)
1) Home (hero: upcoming event CTA; ticker for “Next weigh-in”, “Registration closes in Xd”; sponsor marquee)
2) Events Hub (calendar + filters by city/date/category; event page with schedule, divisions, weigh-in windows, pdf rules, map, lodging)
3) Registration Flow (multi-step: profile → category selection → music upload (MP3) → waiver → payment → receipt; retry/abandoned cart recovery)
4) Live Results & Scoreboards (responsive table/cards; category tabs; “Top 5” spotlight; shareable result URLs)
5) News & Media (articles, galleries, reels; photographer storefront with bundles; preview → paywall → download)
6) Athlete Profile (history, categories, placings, physique updates, social links)
7) Sponsors (tiered placements, promo codes, UTM tracking, rotating hero placements)
8) CRM/Admin (judges panel, check-in lists, lane assignments, category builder, payments dashboard, payouts, bulk email/WhatsApp)
9) Help/FAQ + Policies (anti-doping, refunds, media rights, music specs)
