I talked yoo in another sesión about an IFBB app to do the following, I want you to create a full mockups without payung atention to the tech stack but only create the full website mockups without backend, that actually has all that we e talled about : Perfect — this is a fantastic project idea, and you’re absolutely right: most federations (including IFBB) still run their backend like it’s 2005. Let’s structure this properly so you can start designing and pitching it fast.---🧩 1. Vision SummaryYou want to build an IFBB CRM / Event Platform that modernizes all competitor, judge, and organization workflows into one digital system.🎯 Core GoalsCentralize all event data (competitors, categories, payments, songs, photos, results).Automate registration and payment collection.Improve the competitor experience (upload assets, check lineup, results).Provide federation tools (analytics, feedback, event planning).Enable fans and family to follow live results, streaming, and replays.---🏗️ 2. Core Modules🔹 Competitor PortalRegistration for upcoming events.Automatic category matching based on height/weight.Upload song (MP3, WAV) and posing photo.Secure payment gateway (MercadoPago, Stripe, PayPal).Auto-generated invoice + confirmation email.Dashboard of past competitions, scores, and photos.Download certificates or official results.🔹 Judge & Admin DashboardManage events, categories, competitors, and scores.Upload score sheets or record results live.Generate ranking reports and winner certificates.Add announcements and notifications.🔹 Media & Content HubUpload and manage event photos/videos.Watermarked previews, automatic linking to each athlete.Purchase photos/videos directly online.Livestream integration (YouTube API or embedded player).🔹 Feedback & CommunicationAnonymous or signed feedback forms post-event.Organizer notifications via email or in-app.Internal news board for IFBB members.🔹 Public Portal / AppCalendar of events with dates, cities, registration deadlines.Live leaderboard and streaming links.Competitor profiles with results history.Push notifications (optional mobile app).---⚙️ 3. Technical Stack (Suggested)Layer Recommended ToolsFrontend React + Next.js (SSR for SEO) + TailwindBackend Node.js (NestJS or Express) or Django RESTDatabase PostgreSQL (for structured data) + S3 / Cloud Storage for mediaPayments MercadoPago API (Argentina-friendly) or StripeFile Storage AWS S3 / Google Cloud StorageAuthentication Auth0 or Firebase AuthAdmin Panel AdminJS or custom React panelStreaming YouTube API, Vimeo, or RTMP ingestNotifications OneSignal / Firebase Cloud Messaging---💡 4. Future-Ready Add-onsAI feedback analyzer: sentiment and keyword tracking from reviews.Performance analytics for competitors (based on scores + categories).IFBB federation dashboard (ranking points, attendance stats).API for gyms and coaches to link athlete profiles.Sponsor integration (banners, athlete deals, discount codes).---🧭 5. Next Steps1. Define MVP scope:Registration + Payment + Song Upload + Admin Dashboard.That’s enough for the first version.2. Design UX mockups:Pages: Home, Event List, Register, Upload Song, Payment, Confirmation, Admin Events, Competitor Table.3. Database schema design:Tables: users, competitors, events, categories, registrations, payments, songs, photos, feedback.4. Integrate Payment + File Upload flows.5. Add optional features: streaming, feedback, analytics.---🧱 6. MVP Deliverable ExampleIf you want, I can draft:✅ Database schema (PostgreSQL or Prisma model).✅ UI flow (React or Figma mockup).✅ API endpoints list.✅ Admin dashboard base structure.---Would you like me to start by drafting the database schema + UI flow for MVP (registration + payment + song upload + dashboard)?That’s the foundation of the whole IFBB CRM.

This is an excellent project. A centralized, modern platform is exactly what the industry needs.

Based on our previous conversation, I will now lay out a full, text-based mockup and sitemap for the entire website. This will describe every page, its components, and how users flow between them, focusing purely on the user experience (UX) and flow, with no backend code.

Here is the complete mockup plan for the IFBB platform.

Sitemap (Overall Structure)
The site is divided into three main user-facing sections:

The Public Portal (For fans, visitors, and potential competitors)

The Competitor Portal (Logged-in area for registered athletes)

The Admin/Judge Dashboard (Logged-in area for staff and federation officials)
